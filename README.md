# SEES Admin
An iPad app for SEES office personnel to view and edit student, major, event, and contact information in a Firebase database instance. When the app is first launched, it does a network call to the Firebase instance, where it downloads all the stored data. From there, office personnel are able to add new data or edit current data in real time. Meaning, when new or edited data is pushed back up to the Firebase, a student simply needs to "pull to refresh" on the [SEES iPhone App](https://github.com/robertparsonsdev/SEESApp) in order to view the changes.
